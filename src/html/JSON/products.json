    "description": "Dwarf Low Flyer autoflower marijuana is easy to moderate grow that can thrive in both indoor and outdoor growing spaces. With 70% indica, 20% sativa, and 10% ruderalis and the offspring of a cross between Early Girl, Low Rider, and Ruderalis, this strain is undoubtedly a sure hit. Just like many of the best strains on the market nowadays, this one originated from Spain. At 10.85%, the THC content of this beautiful plant is nowhere as high as some others in Crop Kingâ€™s line, but that is what sets it apart. Dwarf Low Flyer autoflower marijuana delivers a sweet and smooth natural kind of buzz. It is pure fun and relaxation, with no extreme psychedelic or couch-locking effects. This is the perfect smoke for those times you just want to relax for a bit and then go back to what you were doing right after. A good option for beginner smokers and veterans who want something relatively mild for a change.<br>If you are looking for a smaller plant that can easily be stashed away, our Dwarf Low Flyer is the right choice."
